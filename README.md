# csgo-ze-plugins

The csgo ze plugins are mostly private plugins and hard to find. So I created this Github to share with ze server administrators.
These are the plugins and extensions in use on my server, and most plugins were created by other users. And I did a little modification, not much different from the original.

and I also share the entWatch cfg files so you can use them if you need them. (maybe i'm not update anymore)
