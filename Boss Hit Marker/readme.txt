- when you hit the boss, the HUD will be output as X on the crosshair for 0.1 second.
- Enter the boss name in configs - bossname - mapname.cfg, Hit Marker is only active for entities created in cfg.
- Share the cfg in the same path as the Boss Hit Rank plugin.
- I think this plugin is not stable yet.
